Hi there! So nice to see you are intersted in playing our creation!

Our package.json already contains the 'node.js app.js 3000' command in scripts start.

This means that after executing 'npm install' typing 'npm start' should be sufficient
to start the server and start playing!!

The game then will be hosted locally on port 3000 and to actually get to the game
you will need to typ 'localhost:3000' in your browser. 

Have so much fun playing and thanks for using our creation!

Kind regards,
Matthijs van Andel & Berend Bleeker
